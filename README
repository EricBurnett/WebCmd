WebCmd
======
Framework for putting together custom tools into a web interface. Makes it easy
to provide control over services on your local computer through a common
webpage, or to experiment with simple tools a la the Google calculator.

Alpha - this is a work in progress, getting new features and modules as I need
them. May not be too valuable yet, although the on-the-fly transcoding is 
pretty slick.

Written on Windows (x64), but it should be platform agnostic. If you try it on
anything else, let me know how it goes.

Top-level Flags:
 -host: Server address to host on. (":8080" is default).
 -window: Whether to try to open a GUI window. On windows when compiled as a gui
   application and run with --window=false the process runs in the background
   with no visible window whatsoever.
 -resource_path: Where to find resource files. This shouldn't need to be set for
   installed go programs - it will look relative to the location of the 
   executable - but if necessary, set to the source directory 
   (src/github.com/EricBurnett/WebCmd).

Currently Supported Modules:
-------------------
Static File Serving
    SMB making you miserable?  This lets you share files from your local disk
    over standard HTTP for easy access.
    Can't easily play your videos across devices? Video files are wrapped in an
    HTML5 player (disable with --custom_video_player=false), and transcoded on
    the fly to a web-friendly format (disable with --transcode=false).
    
    Notes:
     - Served paths are configured via staticcontent/paths.csv.
     - Player via http://videojs.com
     - You must have ffmpeg or similar for transcoding.
     - Transcoded files can't be seeked, since they're encoded on the fly. If
       you have ideas to make that work without losing the instant playing, give
       me a shout!
     - I've only tested file formats in Chrome, but via --transcode_settings and
       --transcode_content_type you can experiment yourself. If you find other
       browsers like different settings, let me know and I can add 
       browser-specific options.

    Flags:
     (staticcontent/paths.csv to configure paths).
     -custom_video_player: Whether to return an HTML5 player wrapper for video
       files.
     -transcode: Transcode videos to web-friendly formats.
     -transcoder: Path to transcoder to use (ffmpeg is default).
     -transcode_settings: Parameters to pass to transcoder to control output.
     -transcode_content_type: Content type of the transcoded video, for setting
       mime types. (webm is default).
     -verbose_transcode_output: Write extra output to the log file, including
       the stderr messages of the transcoder itself.


Grooveshark Desktop
    Basic player controls for Grooveshark Desktop. Only limited controls are
    supported (support was intended for keyboard shortcuts), but this gives you
    play/pause and next song at least.
    
    Notes:
     - You must set --gs_path to point to the Grooveshark Desktop location to
       enable the module - it won't load if it can't find the file.
       
    Flags:
     -gs_path: The path Grooveshark Desktop installed user data to. Set this
       to enable gsDesktop control.
     -gs_control_file: The file Grooveshark watches. You shouldn't need to
       change this.
